# patient-data-component
This is a patient component made to be integrated into the main window of a medical institute application. This was my first freelance project and the first entry to my real world experiences.

# FAQ
# 1. Why is the data hard coded?
## Ans. The data is hard coded just for reference. The whole component was to be made dynamic at the backend using jQuery and integrated into ASP.NET.
